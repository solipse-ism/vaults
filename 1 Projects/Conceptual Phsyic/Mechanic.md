## Linear Motion
### Decribe/Define
- Inertia: property of thing to reset change in motion (due to mass)
- Force: Rate of change of moomentum
- Mechanical Equlibrium: No change in motion, object remain at rest or at constant velocity, ΣF and ΣM = 0
	- Dynamic: object remain at constant velocity
	- Static: object remain at rest
	- rotational works the same as dynamic or static
- Freefall: air resistant negligible, object falling with no restraint
- Mass: quantity of matter in an object, and a measure of inertia
- Weight: Gravitational force on an object // Force on object due to gravity
### Newton Law of Motion
N1L(law of inertia): a body continues at rest or at constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force
N2L: Net force is proportional to rate of change of momentum, and is in the same direction
N3L: Whenever one object exert a force on a second object, the second object exert the equal and opposite force on the first.
### Equilibrium

### Motion is Relative
To measure the velocity, we need to set it relative to something, Everything is moving
