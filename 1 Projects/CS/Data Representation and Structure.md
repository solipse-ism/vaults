## 01 Information Representation
### Define Question
#### Image
- **Image Resolution**: density of pixel within a given unit length measurement
- **Image dimension**: width and height of an image normally represent with the number of pixel
- **Screen Resolution**: number of pixel that make up the screen display
- **Vector:** made up of drawing object, allows scalability without quality loss
- **Drawing Object**: a fundamental element in a vector image: mathematical expression that define an object
- **Drawing List**: List of drawing object/mathematic commands that make up vector graphic
- **Bit/Colour Depth**: number of bits use to map the colour
#### Sound
- **Sampling**: recording the value of amplitude and store as binary value 
- **Sound Resolution**(bit depth): number of bits use to store amplitude value
- **Sampling Rate**: number of sample per second
#### Compression
- **Lossless**: using algorithm to reduce file size without deleting any information, its rather by reformatting the data in a more compact way => original data can be restore. Ex RLE
- **Lossy**: using algorithm to reduce file size by deleting information(sometimes only unnoticeable data due to human sensing capability) => original data can't be restore
### Number System
- Understand Base System, Binary, Denery and Hexadecimal and Conversion
- Binary vs Denary Prefix
### Mapping Number
- unsign
- sign magnitude
- one's complement
- two's complement
#### BCD: use in calculator display, digital device
- Correction value is 0110 for BCD arithmetic
- easy to convert between binary and decimal
### Mapping Character
- ASCII: 7/8 bits use
- Unicode: 16+ bits use
### Mapping Image
- Bitmap
- Vector
### Mapping Sound
- Sample amplitude at time interval
### Compression Techniques
- Lossy
	- Image: JPG
- Lossless
	- RLE
	- Image: PNG
