	- how crack can be made
	- modern security prevention
	- why these warez scene's cracked app flag by anti-malware as virus
		- ans: Legit warez are detected as malware because they use the same malicious methods to crack games as malware uses to infect your computer. If the malware scanner did not detect the malicious method in a warez file, it wouldn't detect a virus that uses the same malicious method. For example, .dll injection is a method of modifying an actively running process that is used by both private trainers and viruses.
	- cracking community and why they don't publish their method
		- Hey bro, I share the same interest. Maybe you should start looking at Crackwatch community, they have a site and a r/ two. The people/group that crack a game, for example, are called Scene Groups
		- Usually, they don't explain how they hacked into de DRM, to avoid the infosec to improve for the next release. But there are some famous groups with r/ as well, like Empress or Codex. Maybe you should check it out!
		- In some downloads site you're able to download the "crack only" files, usually they are some DLL or something like this. Also, they modified other software files, as the main.exe, so maybe you could try start studying this way, idk

Good luck with this, hope you can join forces against intellectual property hahaha See ya!
