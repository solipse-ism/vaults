## Benefit of Networking
- Sharing of resource  [Hardware, Software(application server), Files (File server)]
	- Reduce Cost
	- can remotely perform task
- Allow communication between users [through email server etc]
## LAN VS WAN
| Features | LAN | WAN |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Direct End System | Yes | No |
| Geographical Area | - | Covers wider than LAN |
| Traffic congestion | Less bc smaller = faster transferate | - |
| Security | - | Less secure bc big and hard to implement protection |
| Ownership | Private | either public/private |
| Connectivity | Often Physical | Often Virtual |
## Network Model: Client Server VS P2P (benefit)
| Client Server | P2P |
| ---- | ---- |
| file/resource centralise(intranet capability), centralise backup |  |
| Creation of security and internet monitoring |  |
| User authentication require to access network |  |
| Cost saving for client (thin client) |  |
| database store on server = less burden on client |  |
### What is Client Server 
- 
#### Thin vs Thick Client
| Feature | Thin | Thick |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
	|  |  |  |
### What is P2P
- 
## Network Topology: Connection Model
### Requirement for Network
1. Sender, Receiver and Data
2. Transmission Medium
3. Protocol
### Transmission Mode and Transmission Transmission Method
| Mode | Method |

| Benefit |  |  |  |  |  |
## Wire/Wireless Connection Method
|  | Option | Benefit of Both |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Wire | Fibre Optic<br>Twisted Pair<br>Coaxial | Hard to interfere, More reliable(hacking, no usage radiowaves, no signal attenuation)<br>Faster Connection (higher bandwidth)<br>More secure |
| Wireless | Radio:sattelite<br>Radio: WLAN/Wifi<br>UHF Radio: Bluetooth | Freedom of movement, more mobile (no physical connection)<br>Easy setup, no expertise needed, less expensive (no cabling)<br>Many different devices can connect at the same time (easy to add more device) |

# The Internet Structure
## Useful Application of the Internet
### Cloud Computing

#### PRIVATE VS PUBLIC
|  | Private | Public |

### Bit Streaming
#### ON DEMAND VS REALTIME
|  | On Demand | Real time |
