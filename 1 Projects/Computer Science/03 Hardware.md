## computer function by
- processing data
- the storage of data
- and the input and output of data
## IOT and Embbedded System
- Device design to perform only one special-function
- requires MCU to work
### IOT (most of the modern embedded system is connected to the network)
- Benefit: improve usefulness and mobility of user when using the device
- Drawback: anyone in the network can access it => security concern, less protected against unlawful action
### Assessing Embedded System
#### Benefits
- Perform only one function = can be mass produce = EOF = cheaper device
- phone provide full user interface
#### Drawback
- low memory available = hard to program = short program made
- in the past, the chip couldn't be rewrite so error made in installation will means new chip will need to be manufacture to replace the old
## RAM and ROM (memory/primary storage)
### SRAM
- use of flip-flop made off transistor, Nand, Nor gates
- faster to access than DRAM
### DRAM
- Use capacitor(charged = 1 and hence otherwise), due to real world imperfection, there are charge leakage and it needs to always be refresh/recharge = use more energy
- use less physical space/component to store one bit
### ROM
- normally use to store bootstrap or embedded program instruction
- [[|ROM's instruction is first copied into RAM to be access by CPU]]
- can't be rewrite once installation complete during manufacturing -> can lead to waste
### PROM
- same as ROM, but content inside the ROM can be programmed by programmer before flashing it.
### EPROM
- Erasable PROM
- Content is erasable thorugh shining the UV onto the chip
### EEPROM 
- Electrical EPROM
- Use electricity to signal and erase the content in the ROM
### Memory and storage
![[Memory and Storage.png]]
### Buffer
- store data that is transmitted faster than it could be receive, it is created in the RAM
- Usage inclulde in bit streaming
