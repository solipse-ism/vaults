## Definition
### Number coding
- **Sign Magnitude**: + - and value
### Text coding
- **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
### Image Coding
- **Image Resolution**: density of pixel within a given unit length measurement
- **Image dimension**: width and height of an image normally represent with the number of pixel
- **Screen Resolution**: number of pixel that make up the screen display
- **Vector:** made up of drawing object, allows scalability without quality loss
- **Drawing Object**: a fundamental element in a vector image: mathematical expression that define an object
- **Drawing List**: List of drawing object/mathematic commands that make up vector graphic
- **Bit/Colour Depth**: number of bits use to map the colour
### Sound Coding
- **Sampling**: recording the value of amplitude and store as binary value 
- **Sound Resolution**(bit depth): number of bits use to store amplitude value
- **Sampling Rate**: number of sample per second
### Compression
- **Lossless**: using algorithm to reduce file size without deleting any information, its rather by reformatting the data in a more compact way => original data can be restore. Ex RLE
- **Lossy**: using algorithm to reduce file size by deleting information(sometimes only unnoticeable data due to human sensing capability) => original data can't be restore
## Number Coding, Negative Number
