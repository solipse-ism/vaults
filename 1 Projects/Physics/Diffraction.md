Coherent - constant phase difference
monochromatic - light of only one frequency

dark spot between two bright fringes. coherent waves are pi phase different from each other -> Destructive interference

path different betweeen 2 coherent waves that produce dark spot - half a wavelenght

Young double sllit

need coherent light, first sllit does that
laser is coherent llight source
