## Terms
- Inertia: The property of things to resist change in motion, due to its mass
- Vector: quantity that has both magnitude and direction
- Equilibrium: ΣF = 0 and ΣM = 0 , the object's motion remain unchange
- Linear Momentum: produce of mass and velocity
- Force: rate of chnage of momentum
## Newton Law of motion
- N1L(law of inertia): Object will remain at rest or at constant velocity unless acted by some net force
- N2L: Force is proportional to rate of chnage in momentum and is in the same direction
- N3L: If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts and equal and opposite force of same type on the first.
## Non uniform motion
- Terminal Velocity: object in equilibrium, velocity is constant
- CLM: The total momentum before equals the total momentum after colision provided that there are no external force
