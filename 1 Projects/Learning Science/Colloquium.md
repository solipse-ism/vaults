# How does AI impact how the general population learns, and can it increase the efficiency of learning?

## INTRODUCTION 
The acquisition of knowledge, a quintessential facet of the human experience, has been significantly influenced by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). In contemporary educational landscapes, the skill of learning is often undervalued, underscoring the need for a profound exploration into the efficiency of learning methods. This inquiry aims to scrutinize the transformative effects of AI on how the general population learns, contemplating its potential to enhance the efficacy of this fundamental cognitive process.

What are the difference between learning and studying? To learn means to aquire knowledge or skills by studying, however the act of studying does not always leads to learning. Why?

Before diving deep into the theory, it is fundamental to understand how memory works in figure 1, famously proposed by Ebbinghause(1885).![[Pasted image 20231118221207.png]]
In his model, sensoy information enters the brain. This information is processed to be stored in memory through the process of encoding. Information stored in memory is then retrieved or "forgotten," where the act of retrieving can facilitate re-encoding. The model also involves the following assumptions, theories and hpothese, which are not evident in the diagram alone:
- The desirable pathway for learning is for information to be encoded into memory and retrieved for varying levels of knowledge mastery.
- Learners are generally unable to significantly modify the raw sensory information that enters the brain. 
- The way in which information is processed is directly related to the cognitive processes that are activated during the learning event.
